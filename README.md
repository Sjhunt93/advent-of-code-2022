# Learnings

In python tabs really make the difference, one wrong indent and it fails silently!
In C types matter so much more than you can imagine, at least an int is an int and not strings (looking at you python!)
Lua is kinda odd, I cant see what advantage is has over python or ruby. The fact it has no += is really anyoing
Nim is really good and I want to learn more about it.
Having spent a year working 90% with python, C++ feels clunky, but I do like its explicit semantics.

Consider writing tests before staring with some solutions. Day 22 was a good example of this.
